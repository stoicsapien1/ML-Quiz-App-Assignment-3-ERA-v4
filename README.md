## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10 or higher** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **uv package manager** - [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Google Gemini API Key** - [Get your free API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

If you have git installed:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ml-quiz-app
```

Or simply download and extract the project files to a folder.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal/command prompt in the project directory and run:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command will:
- Create a virtual environment automatically
- Install all required dependencies (Flask, Google Generative AI, etc.)
- Set up the project for development

### Step 3: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key (you'll need this to run the app)

### Step 4: Run the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

You should see output similar to:
```
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://[your-ip]:5000
 * Debug mode: on
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Dependencies

- **Flask 3.0+**: Web framework for the backend
- **google-generativeai**: Google's Gemini AI client library
- **flask-cors**: Cross-origin resource sharing support
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Serves the main quiz interface
- `POST /generate_quiz`: Generates quiz questions using Gemini AI
- `POST /submit_quiz`: Processes quiz answers and returns results

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

You can create a `.env` file in the project root to set default values:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Customization

The app is highly customizable:

- **Styling**: Modify `static/style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- **Quiz Logic**: Update `main.py` to modify quiz generation or scoring
- **UI Behavior**: Edit `static/script.js` to change frontend interactions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "API key is required" error**
- Make sure you've entered a valid Gemini API key
- Check that the API key is active in your Google AI Studio account

**2. "Failed to generate quiz" error**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if your API key has sufficient quota
- Try a different topic or reduce the number of questions

**3. App won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
- Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- Check that port 5000 is not in use by another application

**4. Styling issues**
- Clear your browser cache
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all static files are properly served

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the terminal/command prompt for error messages
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) to see console errors
3. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Ensure your API key is valid and has quota remaining

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development

The app runs in debug mode by default, which is perfect for development:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set `debug=False` in `main.py`
2. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn
3. Set up proper environment variables
4. Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache) as a reverse proxy

Example with Gunicorn:
```bash
uv add gunicorn
uv run gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
```
